# Web-Crawler
website crawler with Selenium

## The two crawler's were used to scrap real-estate information.
The code is intended to be viewed as a web-scraping referrence only.
The essential keys of deploying a successful crawler:
1. reduce the number of unnecessary calls
2. Proxy Rotation
3. user-agent rotation(less important)
4. Do not call the website too fast.
5. leave sometime for the website to render, so you can have the full elements of the target website.
